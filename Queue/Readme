1. I have made a mini replica of shortest job first scheduler in working.. by using a queue interface(which is implemented by linkedlist) in java. The arrival time 
by default I am considering 0( means all the process arrive at same time). 

2. Asked users to give burst time and process Id as i/p. which is being stored in a list of hashmap- made a customised comparator using which i am sorting the arraylist
on the basis of burst time.

3. Just to show how processess will execute, I have added a wait function for their respective burst times, using the wait method present in the java.lang.object 
package.

Concl: It only occured to me after I wrote the whole program, that i could have created an abstract data type than using a readymade hashmap.
Ex -
Class ProcessDetails {
String ProcessId;
int butstTime;
.... 
}
and pass this as a type check for the Arraylist. 
Thankyou
